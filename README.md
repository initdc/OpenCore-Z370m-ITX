# The Z370m-ITX OpenCore Profile

## Working hardware

- MainBoard: ASRock Z370m-ITX
- GPU Card: RX580

> I tried enable Intel Wi-Fi and bluetooth, but I can't boot my os with `Apple Secure Boot: defult` option in OpenCore, so I disale it.

> Luckily I have some DW1820a, so when I am get time, I
can easily replace it. ( In fact, not easily )
